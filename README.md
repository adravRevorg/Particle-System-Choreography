# Particle-System-Choreography
A particle system simulator with several choreographies

1. 2D flowfields : Particles follow choreography defined by perlin, spiral and magnetic flowfields
2. 3D curves : Particles are choreographed to form 3d curves, like sine, tangent, paraboloid, helix, torus.
3. UI provided to real-time switch between any of the above choreographies.
4. Several parameters provided to change the results (eg. color, path length, width, timestep, noise offset, etc)
5. This is an OOP based project.
